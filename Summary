🔒 Cybersecurity Lab: Access Control Algorithm Implementation

In this project, I developed a Python algorithm for access control in a cybersecurity context. The goal was to parse a text file containing a list of IP addresses allowed to access restricted content and remove addresses no longer authorized.

🛠️ Key Skills Demonstrated:

File Handling: Utilized Python's file handling capabilities to read, manipulate, and rewrite a text file containing IP addresses.

Data Parsing: Employed string manipulation methods such as .split() to convert the file content from a string to a list for easier manipulation.

Algorithmic Thinking: Implemented an algorithm to iterate through the IP addresses, identify and remove those in the removal list, and updated the file accordingly.

Function Design: Structured the code into a reusable function, update_file(), that takes in parameters for the file name and the list of addresses to be removed.

Error Handling: Ensured the algorithm handles potential errors, such as opening and closing files in a with statement, avoiding unnecessary complexities.

📊 Project Overview:

Scenario: Working as a security analyst, the task was to automate the removal of unauthorized IP addresses from an access control list.

Tasks:

Displayed the original file and removal list.
Read and parsed the file, converting it from a string to a list.
Iterated through the list, removing specified addresses.
Updated the original file with the modified list.
Functionality: The update_file() function encapsulates the entire process, making it easy to apply the algorithm to different files and scenarios.

💡 Benefits of Function Integration:

Reusability: The function allows for easy reuse across various files and removal scenarios, promoting code modularity.

Readability: The encapsulation of the algorithm into a function enhances code readability and maintainability.

Scalability: As security needs evolve, the function can be extended or modified to accommodate additional requirements.

🚀 Next Steps:

Exploring further automation possibilities.
Integrating the algorithm into larger cybersecurity workflows.
Enhancing error handling for edge cases.
👩‍💻 Conclusion:
This project showcases my proficiency in Python, file handling, algorithm design, and my ability to contribute to cybersecurity efforts through automation and efficient access control mechanisms.
